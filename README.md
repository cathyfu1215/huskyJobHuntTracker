## Iteration 3:

In iteration 3 we implemented functionalities of external APIs and Notification use. We also fixed bugs in the second iteration about location use and rendering a scrollable view containing virtual lists.

- Issue a notification of each to-do item
- edit, save, and display user's home location , the target company's location and the user's current location
- Browse the top 3 news headlines in the job application record detail page
- Filter and quickly locate a job application record in the main view

### firebase rules of our top collection: Users Collection
```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      //Currently i am allowing registered users to read and write anything.
      
      //The logic is: I am using the uid from Auth to generate the user document id in
      //my Users collection. That is to say, only when users register/log in they will
      //have a unique id, and they will only have access to all the records in their 
      //own user document and its subcollections.
      
      //All of my stored data belongs to specific users and there is no "universal data".
    }
  }
}
```
### firebase rules of our storage

```
rules_version = '2';


service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {

   
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true
    }
  }
}
